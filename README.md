# Quantitative Finance Portfolio

This repository contains projects and experiments in **quantitative finance**, focusing on applying mathematical models, programming, and data analysis to real-world financial problems.  

The goal is to build a portfolio of reproducible Python, R, Matlab, and C# projects that demonstrate key quantitative finance concepts, computational techniques, and algorithmic trading strategies.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Implement **Monte Carlo simulations** for derivative pricing  
- Develop **portfolio optimization models** and visualize efficient frontiers  
- Conduct **time-series analysis and forecasting** for financial market data  
- Explore **algorithmic trading strategies** and backtesting frameworks  

These projects will serve as a bridge between academic knowledge from my MSc in Financial Mathematics and practical, real-world applications.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- **Languages:** Python, R, Matlab, C#  
- **Python Libraries:** NumPy, pandas, SciPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, statsmodels  
- **Other Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, Excel, LaTeX  

---

## 📚 Methodology (Planned)

- Use historical financial data (stocks, indices, derivatives) for analysis  
- Simulate stochastic processes for option pricing (GBM, Monte Carlo)  
- Optimize portfolios using mean-variance frameworks  
- Apply statistical and machine learning methods to forecast volatility or returns  
- Document all results in clean, reproducible notebooks  

---

## 🚀 Roadmap

1. **Option Pricing Engine** – Monte Carlo simulation for European and Asian options  
2. **Portfolio Optimization Dashboard** – Mean-variance optimization and visualization  
3. **Time-Series Analysis & Forecasting** – ARIMA/GARCH/ML-based approaches  
4. **Algorithmic Trading Backtesting** – Test simple strategies on historical data
